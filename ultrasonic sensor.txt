An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.

Ultrasonic sound vibrates at a frequency above the range of human hearing.  

Transducers are the microphones used to receive and send the ultrasonic sound.

Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo.  
The sensor determines
 the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulse.



Why use an Ultrasonic Sensor?
Ultrasound is reliable in any lighting environment and can be used inside or outside.  
Ultrasonic sensors can handle collision avoidance for a robot, and being moved often, as long as it isn’t too fast.  

Ultrasonics are so widely used, they can be reliably implemented in grain bin sensing applications, water level sensing,
 drone applications and sensing cars at your local drive-thru restaurant or bank.

Ultrasonic rangefinders are commonly used as devices to detect a collision.  

Ultrasonic Sensors are best used in the non-contact detection of:


An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.
An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object’s proximity.

Ultrasonics are Independent of:
Light
Smoke
Dust
Color
Material (except for soft surfaces, i.e. wool, because the surface absorbs the ultrasonic sound wave and doesn’t reflect sound.)
 
A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another.
 Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal in another
